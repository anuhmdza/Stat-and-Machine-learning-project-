#  Disease Case Count Prediction Project

This project explores multiple machine learning and statistical models to forecast disease case counts across U.S. states using historical features like temperature, income, rent, immunization, and exemption rates.

##  Files Included
- `disease_case_prediction_final.ipynb` - the complete Jupyter notebook with visualizations, models, and comparisons.
- `final_model_dataset_with_features.csv` - the dataset used for all analyses.
- `visualizations for project (1).ipynb` - the Jupyter notebook for EDA.
- `The actual modeling (1).ipynb` - XGBoost and Random Forrest Modeling + Predictions Per State Per Year
##  Models Used
1. **ARIMA** – basic time series forecasting using case counts.
2. **SARIMA** – time series with seasonal components.
3. **Random Forest Regressor** – tree-based model using all available numeric features.
4. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** – neural network model designed for sequential data.

##  Visualizations
- Trend line of average case counts by year.
- Correlation heatmap of all numeric features.
- Choropleth map showing average case counts by state.
- Model comparison graphs and predictions.

##  Key Findings
- **Random Forest** gave the best predictive performance with the lowest RMSE.
- LSTM and SARIMA showed potential for more sequential modeling but may need further tuning.
- Visualizing data helped uncover trends and correlations that informed model choices.

##  What You’ll Learn
- How to preprocess and visualize a complex dataset.
- How to apply time series and machine learning models to real-world epidemiological data.
- How to evaluate and compare model performance.
- How to build a project pipeline from data to insight.
